# My Go Learning Repository

This is a personal repository dedicated to storing my own Go learning code examples. The code examples are intended for personal reference and learning purposes.

## Description

This repository contains various Go code examples that I have written during my learning journey. Each code file includes some descriptions and explanations in code comments to enhance my understanding of the concepts and techniques used (sorry if some code not using English)

## Learning Sources

The learning sources for this repository are random, as I explore different tutorials, online courses, documentation, etc. Therefore, the code examples may reflect a combination of various resources and learning materials.

Please note that the code examples and descriptions in this repository are primarily for my own personal reference and learning. They may not be optimized or follow best practices. It is recommended to consult official Go documentation and other reliable resources for comprehensive learning.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code examples in this repository. You can navigate through different directories to find specific topics or concepts. Each code file is accompanied by comments explaining the purpose and functionality of the code.

To run the examples, ensure you have Go installed on your machine. You can execute the code by running the following command in your terminal:

```
go run filename.go
```
